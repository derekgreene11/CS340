Team Name
Team 340

Communication method
Teams will be the primary communication method used. Members are expected to respond in a timely manner (24 hours). Email will be used as a backup method. Git will be used for version control. 

Policies
Members shall use Flask and MariaDB for the backend tech stack. Members are invited to share new ideas as they arise. If a disagreement arises related to the project, members shall video conferenceshare screen and google “flip a coin”. The winner’s idea will be the one the group proceeds with for a given disagreement. This project will be managed using GitHub. Members will create their own local copy of the repository to make changes and additions to and commit to remote repository. Members will  determine which tasks each will work on and will keep a log of current and completed progressassignments in the README.md file of the remote GitHub repo. If a member is confused about what to do, they should first view their agreed upon task(s) in the README.md file. If still confused, member should reach out to the other member with questions. In addition, members should utilize the ed discussion to find answers to common questions and issues that others may have already provided resolutions for. If a team member does not hear back from the other team member within 48 hours, send an email to follow up. If unable to reach team member after a period of 48 hours with a due date within 48 hours, member may “take-over” assignments of other member to ensure they are either completed and free from bugserrors by the due date. If a team member falls behind on their portion of the work, let the other team member know as soon as they know they will fall behind. At the very least, members will notify each other within 24 hours if they fall behind or think they will fall behind. This ensures that members can adequately assess the amount of work that needs to be completed by each due date. Emergencies may arise and in such case, members may request to make up for not contributing as much one week by contributing more another week. In the case of an emergency, members are expected to notify the other member as soon as possible (within 24 hours). Both teammates are expected to contribute equally. If a team member fails to contribute sufficiently the other member may complete the work for them to ensure it is finished by the due date. In such cases, the member who failed to contribute sufficiently may contribute more work in future weeks if the other member desires.
