# Group Policy
## Members

Greene, Derek- member  
Schuler, Nathan- member

## Team Name

Team 340

## Communication method

Teams will be the primary communication method used for direct collaboration. 
Direct collaborations are those that need a response within 24 hours. Email or 
Teams can be used for planning, outlining tasks, or general communications that 
do not require immediate response.  If a response is solicited in a general 
communication, 48 hours is an acceptable response time. General communications 
also includes a forum for communicating progress or issues.  Members should be 
relied upon to either complete their work, or inform members of issues as soon 
as they are aware a deadline cannot be reached.

Git will be used for version control. 

## Policies

1. ### Conflict Resolution  

    1.1  Members are invited to share new ideas as they arise.  
    1.2  Disagreement shall be confronted and resolved through the following 
    process:  
        1.2.1  Conversation per the __Communication Method__ policy  
        1.2.2  Video conference  
        1.2.3  Google "flip a coin" when members cannot reach a consensus. 
        Members agree to to accept the random resolution and proceed with the 
        result as final  
    1.3 Members are expected to contribute equally per __Section 3__.
    1.4 Members shall outline tasking per __Section 3__ for each project deliverable. 
    When emergencies arise, or members struggle to complete their tasks, the 
    group will work to keep tasking equal in future scope when a member fails to 
    deliver on their outlined scope.

2. ### Tools  

    2.1 Flask shall be used as ...    <!--TODO: description of Flask function-->  
    2.2 MariaDB shall be used as the backend DBMS.  
    2.3 GitHub shall be used for project management and source control  
        2.3.1 Tasking shall be outlined in repository README.md  
        2.3.2 Members shall work locally and push commits to the remote 
        repository with commit messages as defined in 2.3.3.  
        2.3.3 Commit messages shall be of the form: {TAG: description of commit}
        <!--
         TODO: I think it would be beneficial to allow commit messages 
         Demonstrate the completeness of task.  If a task is incomplete due to 
         confusion or a problem that a member is struggling to solve, the commit 
         message should convey this to inform other members of the issue.  
         I'm thinking of using TAGS in the form of:
            COMPLETE: description of completed work
            INCOMPLETE: description of completeness and specifics as to issue 
            resulting in INCOMPLETE. ie confusion, struggling with implementation, 
            need help with, falling behind ect. A commit message using this tag 
            can also add a little detail about planned method for resolution 
            such as researching ED, ect.
            IN-PROCESS: commit for collaboration which is safe to fetch. Not 
            Necessarily due to issues, struggling, or needing help, rather to 
            support other ongoing work while further implementation details are 
            getting added/worked on.

3. ### Tasking

    3.1 Tasking shall be outlined in repository README.md.  
    3.2 Tasking shall be outlined at the beginning of each deliverable.  
    3.3 Tasking shall include:
    3.3.1 Scope of work
    3.3.2 Anticipated commit date of not less than 48 hours before project 
    deliverable deadline. This is to allow other members flexibility in ensuring 
    deadlines are met with the appropriate requirements. If scope cannot be met 
    by the owner within this time period, other members may take ownership of 
    the scope.
    3.4 Tasks are considered complete when a commit message is tagged as 
    COMPLETE per 2.3.3 <!--TODO: check section once draft is complete-->
    
<!--
Members shall use Flask and MariaDB for the backend tech stack. Members are 
invited to share new ideas as they arise. If a disagreement arises related to 
the project, members shall video conference share screen and google “flip a coin”. 
The winner’s idea will be the one the group proceeds with for a given disagreement. 
This project will be managed using GitHub. 

Members will create their own local copy of the repository to make changes and 
additions to and commit to remote repository. Members will  determine which tasks 
each will work on and will keep a log of current and completed progress assignments 
in the README.md file of the remote GitHub repo. If a member is confused about 
what to do, they should first view their agreed upon task(s) in the README.md 
file. If still confused, member should reach out to the other member with questions. 
In addition, members should utilize the ed discussion to find answers to common 
questions and issues that others may have already provided resolutions for. 
If a team member does not hear back from the other team member within 48 hours, 
send an email to follow up. If unable to reach team member after a period of 48 
hours with a due date within 48 hours, member may “take-over” assignments of 
other member to ensure they are either completed and free from bugs errors by 
the due date. If a team member falls behind on their portion of the work, let 
the other team member know as soon as they know they will fall behind. At the 
very least, members will notify each other within 24 hours if they fall behind 
or think they will fall behind. This ensures that members can adequately assess 
the amount of work that needs to be completed by each due date. Emergencies may 
arise and in such case, members may request to make up for not contributing as 
much one week by contributing more another week. In the case of an emergency, 
members are expected to notify the other member as soon as possible (within 24 hours). 
Both teammates are expected to contribute equally. If a team member fails to 
contribute sufficiently the other member may complete the work for them to 
ensure it is finished by the due date. In such cases, the member who failed to 
contribute sufficiently, may contribute more work in future weeks if the other 
member desires.
