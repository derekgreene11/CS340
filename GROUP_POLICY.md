## Team Name

Team 340

## Communication method

Teams will be the primary communication method used for direct collaboration. 
Direct collaborations are those that need a response within 24 hours. Email or 
Teams can be used for planning, outlining tasks, or general communications that 
do not require immediate response.  If a response is solicited in a general 
communication, 48 hours is an acceptable response time. General communications 
also includes a forum for communicating progress or issues.  Members should be 
relied upon to either complete their work, or inform members of issues as soon 
as they are aware a deadline cannot be reached.

Git will be used for version control. 

## Policies
